Hello,

 

Thank you for contacting us. We're happy to help!

Please try the following Troubleshooting steps with us:


	
Swap the RX/TX connections to see if that helps.
	
Ensure the USB cable is unplugged.
	
Make sure the BlackBox is powered by a 24V source.
	
Connect at 115200 baud rate.
	
Send only newlines ("\n"); no carriage returns are needed after commands.
	
Review the documentation:
	

		
BlackBox X32 AUX Serial
		
GRBL v1.1 Interface
	
	


If the system is alarmed, pressing the RESET button on the BlackBox should trigger a [MSG:'$H'|'$X' to unlock] message in the serial log. You might not get a response if there's a lockout. Clear it by sending $X. Learn more about this in the GRBL documentation under Feedback Messages > Non Queried > Second bullet point.

Pressing RESET on the BlackBox while monitoring Serial should show the firmware startup string, like "GrblHAL 1.1f ['$' or '$HELP' for help]", without anything sent over serial. This might help as a quick communication check.
